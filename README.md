# 💉 Feed Reader Testing 💉

> This is submission for the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Project 4.

## About 💎

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

In this project we have been assigned to complete a incomplete test suite of a web-based application that reads RSS feeds.
